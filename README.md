# ðŸ“˜ Schematica: Modern Collaborative API Documentation Platform		

![schematica-cover-with-text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e73d72fd-3d32-4300-b8c7-b023c3e687ec)

This repository contains the **frontend source code** for Schematica.

This is a personal project of mine that I developed a few years ago. It is an API documentation platform based on OpenAPI (similar to Swagger), but developed with a few more features and a better UI (IMHO), written from the ground up.

The goal of this project was to automate a lot of the hassle of maintaining OpenAPI documentation and reduce the friction between backend and frontend teams. Please read the [âœ¨ Features & Quirks](#-features--quirks) section to get an understanding of this project.
